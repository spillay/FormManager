## User
### Installation
```npm install @spillay/FormManager```
### Usage
Please note that this is a work in progress, the general idea is to define the form as a JSON object, what the code does is parses
this and dynamically displays a form. The main purpose of the project is to simplify the creation of forms, apply validation and provide the 
captured input.
